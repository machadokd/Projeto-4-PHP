# Heart Diseases Risk Calculator Website

## Project developed for college 

This project involves the creation of a comprehensive web platform designed to calculate an individual's cardiovascular risk and offer personalized recommendations if their risk level surpasses 5%. The application also facilitates the logging of historical calculations. This feature empowers users to save their cardiovascular risk assessments and input parameters. This stored data serves as a basis for future comparisons or for consultation during medical analysis.

The application caters to three distinct user categories: unregistered users, registered users, and administrators. To initiate the project's execution, we undertook a meticulous study of scientific literature and expert opinions. This research was pivotal in comprehending the intricacies of scoring methods and the underlying calculation techniques.

Following an exhaustive review of these articles, we conducted a comprehensive survey of online calculators that employ scoring methodologies. Drawing from this research, we embarked on the project's development, employing two distinct backend frameworks: one utilizing PHP and the other utilizing Node.js. In both instances, MySQL was selected as the preferred database system to efficiently manage data storage.

The frontend of the application was crafted using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure an intuitive and engaging user experience. This holistic approach to development ensures the platform's reliability, accuracy, and accessibility for all users.
